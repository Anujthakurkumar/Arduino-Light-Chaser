## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- 13 x LEDs  
- 1 x Resistor  
- Breadboard  
- Jumper Wires  

## 💻 What It Does
Lights chase across 13 LEDs using digital pins and delay logic — great for learning **sequential programming** and **microcontroller basics**.

## 🔐 Cybersecurity Relevance
Understanding embedded systems is key to **IoT security**. Projects like this help grasp how devices can be **vulnerable to manipulation** and how to secure them.
